# Perfume-recommendation-project
A beginner-friendly perfume recommendation system using Python and pandas. Users can search perfumes by notes or find similar perfumes based on fragrance profiles. Includes visualizations, filtering logic, and a reverse search engine

## 🔍 What It Does

- 📦 Cleans and explores a real perfume dataset
- 🔎 Lets users search perfumes by notes (e.g., "vanilla", "rose")
- ✅ Supports both ALL and ANY note match modes
- 🔁 Includes a reverse search: input a perfume name and find similar perfumes
- 📊 Includes bar charts and a word cloud for visual analysis
- 📈 Ranks results by match % for better recommendations

- ## 🧰 Tools Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas 🧹
- Matplotlib 📊
- WordCloud 🎨
- Google Colab 📒

- ## 💡 How to Use

1. Clone the repo or open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload the `final_perfume_data.csv` file
3. Run each cell to clean, explore, and interact with the model
4. Use functions like:
   - `recommend_any_note(["vanilla", "musk"])`
   - `recommend_similar_perfumes("Velvet Fantasy Eau de Parfum")`
