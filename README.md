# Perfume-recommendation-project
A beginner-friendly perfume recommendation system using Python and pandas. Users can search perfumes by notes or find similar perfumes based on fragrance profiles. Includes visualizations, filtering logic, and a reverse search engine

##  What It Does

- Cleans and explores a real perfume dataset
   Lets users search perfumes by notes (e.g., "vanilla", "rose")
- Supports both ALL and ANY note match modes
- Includes a reverse search: input a perfume name and find similar perfumes
- Includes bar charts and a word cloud for visual analysis
- Ranks results by match % for better recommendations

- ## Tools Used

- Python 
- Pandas 
- Matplotlib 
- WordCloud 
- Google Colab 

- ##  How to Use

1. Clone the repo or open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload the `final_perfume_data.csv` file
3. Run each cell to clean, explore, and interact with the model
4. Use functions like:
   - `recommend_any_note(["vanilla", "musk"])`
   - `recommend_similar_perfumes("Velvet Fantasy Eau de Parfum")`
